      "List comprehension offers a much more compact and Pythonic way to achieve the same result.\n",

      "## The Basic Structure of List Comprehension\n",
      "\n",
      "The general syntax for list comprehension is:\n",
      "\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",

      "2.  **`for item in iterable`**: This is a standard `for` loop construct.\n",
      "    *   `item`: This is a variable that will take on each value from the `iterable` one by one.\n",
      "    *   `iterable`: This can be any Python object that can be iterated over, such as a list, tuple, string, range, set, or dictionary (iterating over dictionary keys by default).\n",

      "## How it Works (Mental Model)\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it as a shorthand for the `for` loop and `append` pattern. For each `item` in the `iterable`, the `expression` is evaluated, and its result is collected into the `new_list`.\n",
